# Social-Drafters
Social Drafters is a student-run initiative in the field of humanities and social sciences. We, at Social Drafters, aim for an efficient dissemination of information and knowledge. We provide a platform for students from the field of humanities, to showcase their critical thinking and academic capabilities by publishing their research articles. Alongside, we also provide the students with information about the latest events and opportunities available to them.
